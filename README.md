# KnapScal-core

*Scala library for the Knapsack problem*



### Introduction

KnapScal-core is a Scala library for the Knapsack problem.

Although it represents the kernel of the [KnapScal](https://github.com/giancosta86/KnapScal) didactic application, you can use it for your own software: this mathematical engine can be integrated into command-line programs as well.

For further information about referencing it, please visit [its page on the Hephaestus repository](https://bintray.com/giancosta86/Hephaestus/KnapScal-core).



### Requirements

KnapScal-core requires Java 8 Update 45 or later compatible version.

Scala 2.11 or later compatible version is recommended.
